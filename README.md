# 🧍‍♂️📈 Footfall Analysis for Optimizing Retailer Stall Placements

A statistical analysis project conducted as part of the MSc Business Analytics programme at **Warwick Business School** (Oct–Nov 2024). The objective was to analyse foot traffic data and recommend the most strategic stall placements to maximise visibility and customer engagement for a retail client.

## 📌 Project Overview

Using **R** and **RStudio**, we cleaned and analysed footfall data collected from different stall locations within a retail layout. Statistical tests, including **t-tests**, were applied to compare performance across zones and identify statistically significant placement differences.

The results were presented in a structured business report, offering evidence-based recommendations for stall optimisation and layout strategy.
